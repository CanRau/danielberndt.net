I'm a web developer with a background in computer linguistics and machine learning.

These days I'm working on helping game devs (and others) to add some delight to their project management routines. Check out what [Manu](https://twitter.com/supamanu) and I did on [codecks](https://www.codecks.io) here!

## Technologies

### Current Stack

- **javascript/node**

  With the advent of ES6 javascript became a real nice language.

  - **React**

    I started using it early 2014 and haven't looked back. The eco system has matured a lot and I find my work to be really productive with it when working on big and small projects.

  - **webpack**

    It's configuration can be quite fiddly at times. But it's so so powerful for almost all aspects of frontend asset handling, it's worth it!

- **ruby**

  My go to choice for backend programming. Lot's of very robust libraries for all kinds of problems (ORM, throttling, etc...). The ecosystem starts showing it's age though and of course performance tends to be an issue...

- **PostgreSQL**

  Not much left I could wish for when it comes to data storage!

### Past Stacks

In the past I've worked with angular 1, play framework 2, scala, java, android, python, mysql and a lot of hand made libraries since I found this to be one of the better ways of learning.

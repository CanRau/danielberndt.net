                p this is my current gig. Here I'm participating at creating a white-label education platform to offer a first-class personalised learning environment. For me this is a great combination to combine my passion for modern, user-centric web development and top-notch machine learning algorithms.

                p piq started off as a simple page with a simple flash drawing app. During the course of time it developed into a thriving community of pixel art fans from all over the world who enjoy using the app.

                p HellDefence was developed in a 4 week period as a side project (and as my first more serious attempt of creating a game). It takes elements from tower defence and real-time strategy games, and lets the user play through 30 levels. It contains an extensive upgrading system as well as achievements and a survival mode. Since it was released in August 2011 it got about 100 downloads a day and an average rating of >4.5 stars.
